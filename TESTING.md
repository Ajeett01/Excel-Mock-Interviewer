    description: 'Analyze quarterly sales data',
    skill_level: 'intermediate',
    time_limit: 15,
    required_functions: ['SUM', 'AVERAGE', 'VLOOKUP']
  },
  // ... more tasks
];
```

#### Sample User Actions
```typescript
const mockUserActions = [
  {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    type: 'cell_edit',
    cell_reference: 'A1',
    new_value: '=SUM(B1:B10)',
    formula: '=SUM(B1:B10)'
  },
  // ... more actions
];
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Services**: 90%+ coverage
- **Components**: 85%+ coverage
- **Utilities**: 95%+ coverage
- **API Endpoints**: 90%+ coverage
- **Overall**: 88%+ coverage

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Excel Interview Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test:coverage
      - run: npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update test data monthly
- Review and update test scenarios quarterly
- Performance test optimization bi-annually
- Security test updates as needed

### Test Quality Metrics
- Test execution time < 5 minutes for full suite
- Flaky test rate < 2%
- Test maintenance effort < 10% of development time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Luckysheet Loading Issues**: Ensure proper DOM setup in tests
2. **API Mocking**: Use proper mock implementations for external services
3. **Async Operations**: Handle promises and async operations correctly
4. **State Management**: Reset state between tests

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- excel-evaluation.service.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Debug specific test
npm test -- --debug excel-evaluation.service.test.ts
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for APIs and external services
3. **Descriptive Test Names**: Use clear, descriptive test names
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow AAA pattern in tests
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Performance Considerations**: Monitor test execution time
7. **Regular Updates**: Keep tests updated with code changes

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the Excel Mock Interviewer system is robust, reliable, and provides accurate assessments. Regular execution of these tests maintains system quality and user confidence.
